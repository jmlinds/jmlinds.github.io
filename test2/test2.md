I am a graduate student at University of Washington's School of Aquatic and
Fishery Sciences (SAFS), advised by Dr. Kristin Laidre. <!-- would be cool to link to her page -->
My research is focused on quantifying the relationship between ringed seal (*Pusa hispida*) lairs and snow characteristics
in the context of Arctic climate change. I work with collaborators at the Polar Ecosystems Program
at NOAA's Marine Mammal Lab, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Columbia University,
the Native Village of Kotzebue, and Farthest North Films. I graduated from the University of Montana
in 2015 with a B.S. in Wildlife Biology and minors in Mathematics and Climate Change Studies.
For my undergraduate research, I used playback experiments to study the acoustic mimicry of bird alarm
calls in walnut sphinx caterpillars. Outside of my research, I love spending time with my cat,
painting wildlife, drinking lots of tea, and reading sci-fi/fantasy.

#Funders
My research has been supported by a SAFS fellowship, Achievement Rewards for College Scientists,
the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the North Pacific Research Board Graduate Student
Research Award, and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.
