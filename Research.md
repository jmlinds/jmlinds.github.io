My research is focused on the spring denning habitat of ringed seals (*Pusa hispida*, or *natchiq* in I&ntilde;upiaq), which are
ice-associated seals that give birth to their pups in snow-covered lairs. This unique strategy means that
ringed seals are likely to face unique challenges under climate change. To better predict how changes in snow and sea ice conditions will impact ringed seals, we first need to learn more about lair habitat
requirements.

The first chapter of my dissertation research addresses this by investigating spatiotemporal
patterns in ringed seal counts at broad spatial scales in the eastern Bering and Chukchi Seas. This project
uses previously collected aerial survey data collected by scientists from the Polar Ecosystems Program at NOAA's
Marine Mammal Lab. Ringed seal detections from these aerial surveys are then modeled in relation to snow and sea ice variables from satellite remote sensing and short-term weather variables from reanalysis datasets.

I am also involved in a more local-scale effort to study ringed seal habitat through the interdisciplinary
project Ikaa&#289;vik Sikukun (I&ntilde;upiaq for "Ice Bridges"). The project is funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore
Foundation and led by PIs at
Columbia University, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, the Native Village of Kotzebue, and
Farthest North Films. The research questions for Ikaa&#289;vik Sikukun were co-developed
with an Indigenous Elder Advisory Council of four local Inupiaq elders, and their collaboration has been
a key component throughout the project. The ringed seal piece of this project uses a combination of on-ice data collection and aerial surveys from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

Films. To watch Sarah's 10-minute short film about Ikaa&#289;vik Sikukun's seal research (for both *natchiq* and *ugruk*, I&ntilde;upiaq for bearded seals) click the link below.

Research Award, and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.
